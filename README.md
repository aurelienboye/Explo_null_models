# Randomisation methods for building null models in the context of trait over(under)-dispersion analysis (in French)

You can find at this [link](https://aurelienboye.github.io/Trait_null_models_French/Null_models.html) some thoughts and references that helped me select which methodology to use to look at trait over- and underdispersion in our [article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12987) published in Diversity and distributions in 2019:

Boyé, A, Thiébaut, É, Grall, J, et al. Trait‐based approach to monitoring marine benthic data along 500 km of coastline. *Divers Distrib.* 2019; 25: 1879– 1896.

For now it is all in French, sorry, but I hope to find time some days to translate everyting if some people find it useful !
